# Student Registration System

A simple web-based student registration system built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This system allows users to register students, edit existing records, and delete records. Data is persisted using local storage.

## Features

- **Registration Form**: Input fields for student name, ID, email, and contact number with validation.
- **Data Persistence**: Records are stored in the browser's local storage and persist after page refresh.
- **Edit and Delete**: Modify or remove existing student records.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
- **Validation**: Ensures data integrity with regex-based validation.
- **Dynamic Scrollbar**: Adds vertical scrollbar when there are many records.


## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – For structuring the web page using semantic elements

- **CSS3** – For styling, layout, and responsiveness

- **JavaScript (ES6)** – For DOM manipulation, validation, and local storage handling
